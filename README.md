# 🚦 Traffic Signal Simulation  

## 📌 Overview  
This project simulates a **4-lane traffic intersection** with dynamic traffic signal control using **OpenCV** to calculate vehicle density. The simulation adapts green signal timing based on real-time density analysis, making the system more efficient compared to static signals.  

---

## 🛣️ Simulation Setup  

- **4 Lanes** at the intersection.  
- **Each lane has 4 divisions**:  
  - 2 ongoing (forward flow).  
  - 2 outgoing (exit flow).  
- **Signal timing**:  
  - Static base time = **90 sec** (for each lane).  
  - Signals switch **clockwise**.  
- **Zebra Crossings** included for pedestrians.

## ⚙️ Logic for Dynamic Control  

### 🔹 Density Calculation  
1. Capture vehicle density using **OpenCV**.  
2. Use **masks** for each direction: **North, South, East, West**.  
3. Compute density values per second (e.g., `North = 0.56, South = 0.78`).  
4. Formula (concept):  

\[
\text{Density} = \frac{\text{Vehicle Area Covered}}{\text{Total Lane Area}}
\]

### 🔹 Dynamic Green Light Rules  

- If **density < 0.3** for **5+ sec** → reduce time by **40%**.  
- If **0.4 ≤ density ≤ 0.6** → reduce time by **25%**.  
- If **density ≥ 0.7** → no change.  
- **Best case**: 30 sec green light.  
- **Worst case**: 90 sec green light.

## 🔄 Execution Flow (Efficient Green Light Control)  

1. **Start green light** (e.g., North) → `time = 90 sec`.  
2. **First 10 sec**:  
- Cars move normally.  
- Keep capturing density values (but no decisions yet).  
3. **After 10 sec**:  
- Use **sliding averages** of last 5 sec to smooth density:  
  - (0–5), (1–6), (2–7), … until current time.  
4. **Every 5 sec**, apply rules:  
- Density < 0.3 → reduce remaining time by 40%.  
- 0.4 ≤ Density ≤ 0.6 → reduce remaining time by 25%.  
- ≥ 0.7 → keep same.  
5. **Time adjustment method**:  
- Apply reduction step by step, not all at once.  
- Example: If 60 sec left and density < 0.3 → `60 × 0.6 = 36 sec`.  
6. **Repeat** until green time ends.  
7. **Switch clockwise** to the next direction.

## 📊 Example Density Flow  

| Direction | Density | Action | Adjusted Time |
|-----------|---------|--------|---------------|
| North     | 0.25    | Reduce 40% | 90 → 54 sec |
| South     | 0.45    | Reduce 25% | 90 → 67 sec |
| East      | 0.72    | No change | 90 sec |
| West      | 0.31    | Reduce 40% | 90 → 54 sec |

## 📈 Efficiency Analysis  

- **Static System**:  
  - Each lane always gets **90 sec**, total cycle = **360 sec**.  
  - Even empty lanes waste full green time.  

- **Dynamic System**:  
  - **Best Case (Low Traffic All Sides)**:  
    - Each lane = **30 sec** → total cycle = **120 sec**.  
    - Efficiency gain ≈ **67% faster** than static.  
  - **Worst Case (High Traffic All Sides)**:  
    - Each lane = **90 sec** → total cycle = **360 sec**.  
    - Same as static, no gain (but never worse).  

✅ On average, this system saves **30–60% of cycle time** compared to static signals.
